 //Creating objects using Constructors
 // A JavaScript constructor is a function that creates objects 
 // and gives them a set of built-in properties and methods

 // Anatomy of the Constructor
 // Each time you call a constructor, 
 // it creates an object and gives the new object built-in properties.
